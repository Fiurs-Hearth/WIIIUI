## Known issues
* When adding something to an empty minimap actionslot the icon is enlarged, please reload UI from config menu.
* When adding something to an empty extra inventory slot the icon is enlarged, please pick it up with left mouse click and put it back or reload UI.
* When adding something to an empty actionslot in the actiongrid the icon is enlarged, please pick it up with left mouse click and put it back or reload UI.
* Undead male's animated portrait looks bugged, a fault caused by Blizzard and not the addon, this is the reason why I added the menu option to disable portrait animation.
* If other issues arrive, try to note down what you did to create this issue and please contact me at Fiur#8648, in the meantime please reload UI.
