## Known issues
* The UI looks wrong? Try reloading the UI from the config menu, if that doesn't work, hit Escape to open the game's Main Menu, click 'Video Options' and either uncheck 'Use UI Scale' if it's checked or
* Options not saving is likely because your files are set to 'Read only', please look up how to remove 'Read only' as it is different depending on your OS.
* When adding something to an empty minimap actionslot the icon is enlarged, please reload UI from config menu.
* When adding something to an empty extra inventory slot the icon is enlarged, please pick it up with left mouse click and put it back or reload UI.
* When adding something to an empty actionslot in the actiongrid the icon is enlarged, please pick it up with left mouse click and put it back or reload UI.
* Undead male's animated portrait looks bugged, a fault caused by Blizzard and not the addon, this is the reason why I added the menu option to disable portrait animation.
* If other issues arrive, try to note down what you did to create this issue and please contact me at Fiur#8648, in the meantime please reload UI.
